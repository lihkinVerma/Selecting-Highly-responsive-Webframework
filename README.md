# Selecting-Highly-responsive-webframework
This codebase aims to propose a solution for selection of highly responsive web framework from options available in python. In particular I have shown comparison of Flask, FastApi and Falcon web framework for selecting lightIight micro web framework with only requirement of serving to write and deploy backend code. I used Apache benchmarking tool for finding relevant criterions for framework comparison and with an optimization problem statement at hand, I used Analytical Hierarchy Processing algorithm for finding solution to Multiple Criterion Decison making problem.

Below are steps involved to run the comparison:-
